This repository contains the code and models of the paper **"Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Breast Cancer Prognostic: Application and Comparison Based on a Retrospective Cohort Study"**

**You can use this repository to**
1. build your own predictive models based on your data
2. use our models to get risk score of the breast cancer patients
3. use your data with independent variable and survival outcomes to verify our models 

**Following are the guidelines help you to use our code and data template:**
1. Please move all the files and codes to the path"C:\code"
2. The details of the code of Cox-EN, SVM and RSF are in https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
3. The order of the codes are mlmain.py cindexandroc.R kmcurves.py
